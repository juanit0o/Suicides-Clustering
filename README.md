# Clustering Analysis on Global Suicides
This paper focused on the analysis of global suicides and to check if the clustering of the data was done in a way that proved that there were specific attributes/underlying features that determined the number of suicides (sex, age, country, gdp...).
The code was written in R as an experiment to learn the ins and outs of it and the report was written in portuguese.
